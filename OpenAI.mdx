Step 1. Install the OpenSesame SDK:

<CodeGroup>

```bash python 
pip install opensesame-sdk
```
```bash javascript 
npm i opensesame-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Set up the OpenSesame_openai client and add API keys

<CodeGroup>

```bash python 

from opensesame import OpenSesame_openai

client = OpenSesame_openai({
    "api_key" : "your_openai_api_key",
    "open_sesame_key" : "your_open_sesame_key",
    "project_name" : "open_sesame_project_name" # Ensure this is correct
    })
```
```bash javascript 

const OpenSesame = require('opensesame-sdk');

// Replace this code (your OpenAI client)
const openai = new OpenAI(
       apiKey: "your OpenAI key here",
    );

// With this: your OpenSesame client
const opensesame = new OpenSesame({
      apiKey: "your OpenAI key here",
      openSesameKey: "your OpenSesame key",
      projectName: "your desired project name"
    });
```
</CodeGroup>

Step 3. Make a request just like the OpenAI sdk

<CodeGroup>

```bash python 

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model = “gpt-3.5-turbo”,
    messages = [{“role” : “user”, “content” : “user prompt”}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

```

</CodeGroup>
