Step 1. Install the OpenSesame SDK:

<CodeGroup>

```bash python 
pip install opensesame-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Set up the OpenSesame client, add API key and project name

<CodeGroup>

```python 

from opensesame import OpenSesame

os = OpenSesame(
        open_sesame_key = "your_open_sesame_api_key",
        project_name = "your_project_name"
    )

# Your code to generate the LLM response

os.evaluate(prompt="The user prompt", answer="The LLM response")
```

</CodeGroup>

All calls to OpenSesame are made Async so it will not slow down your code execution.
