## 4. Testing Mode

**Testing Mode** in OpenSesame allows you to evaluate your AI agent’s responses and actions in real-time. This feature lets you interact with your agent by sending prompts one at a time, helping you refine its performance and improve accuracy based on immediate feedback.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Testing**: Activate Testing Mode by clicking the play button. This lets you input prompts or actions for your agent to process individually, allowing you to see each response in real time.
  
- **Step-by-Step Evaluation**: Testing Mode is designed to test actions one by one, giving you a clear view of how your agent processes each prompt. This lets you make adjustments on the spot to improve accuracy or adjust the agent’s behavior.

- **Memory Feature (Coming Soon)**: We’re working on adding a memory feature that will allow your agent to retain context across multiple prompts. For now, each prompt is handled independently, but memory will soon enable the agent to build context based on previous interactions.

### In-Depth Analysis

Each prompt sent in Testing Mode provides an opportunity to analyze and tweak your agent’s performance. This step-by-step approach is particularly useful for fine-tuning responses to align with specific objectives or to eliminate unwanted behaviors.

This Testing Mode feature provides the feedback loop needed to build more reliable and responsive agents, ensuring each interaction with your AI agent is accurate and contextually relevant.
