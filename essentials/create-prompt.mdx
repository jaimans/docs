## 1. Enter a Prompt and Start Building Your Agent

The **Enter a Prompt** section is where your creative process begins. This prompt sets the foundation for your AI agent, defining its purpose and functionality. You can either enter your own unique prompt or select from a variety of templates available within the OpenSesame platform.

### Step 1: Enter a Creative Prompt

In your OpenSesame dashboard, enter a prompt describing what you want your agent to accomplish. This can be a simple command or a more detailed description, depending on your needs. For a quick start, you can select one of our **template prompts** to watch an agent appear on your screen and explore how it functions.

### Step 2: Customize Tools and LLM Nodes

Once your agent is generated, you have the flexibility to adjust its structure by choosing specific tools or Large Language Model (LLM) nodes. OpenSesame allows you to:
- **Add Tools**: Select tools from our library or create custom tool nodes to add unique capabilities to your agent.
- **Edit Nodes**: Modify existing nodes or add new ones to fine-tune how your agent processes data and responds to prompts.
- **Continuous Prompting**: Keep entering prompts to further edit or adapt your agent’s structure. For example, you might change specific nodes to enhance the agent’s decision-making or response accuracy.

### Additional Customization Options

With OpenSesame, you’re not limited to predefined options. The platform allows for in-depth customization, enabling you to build agents from scratch or integrate tools and models into the existing framework to create highly specialized agents.

This section empowers you to bring your vision to life, offering full control over the prompts, tools, and frameworks that shape your AI agent.
