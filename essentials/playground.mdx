## 5. Test Playground

The Test Playground is your interactive tool for fact-checking AI-generated responses in real time. It's designed to give you immediate feedback on the accuracy of outputs from various language models (LLMs) by providing detailed insights into the reasoning behind each response and the sources that support it.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time AI Fact-Checking**: Paste any response generated by an LLM into the Test Playground, and our algorithm will instantly evaluate it, providing you with an accuracy score based on the context and facts present in the response.

- **Reasoning Behind Scores**: Alongside the accuracy score, the Test Playground provides a clear and concise explanation of the reasoning behind the evaluation.

- **Source Verification**: The algorithm cross-references the information provided by the LLM with trusted sources to validate the facts.

### How It Works

**Paste the Response + Press Analyze**: Simply paste any text output from an LLM into the Test Playground
