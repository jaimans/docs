## 6. Agent JSON

The **Agent JSON** feature in OpenSesame provides you with full access to the underlying JSON structure of each AI agent you create. This allows for deeper customization, enabling you to edit, modify, or export the JSON configuration to fit specific use cases or integrate with external frameworks.

### Accessing Agent JSON

- **JSON View**: Click on the code icon located on the right sidebar to open the JSON view for your agent. This gives you a complete breakdown of the agent’s structure, configurations, and node relationships.
  
- **Editable Fields**: Each JSON file includes editable fields, allowing you to adjust parameters, add new nodes, or change tool configurations directly within the JSON. This flexibility is ideal for users who want precise control over agent behavior.

### Customization Options

- **Modify and Extend**: You can add custom attributes, configure tool settings, and adjust workflows to meet specific needs. This is useful for integrating custom tools, refining data processing, or setting advanced actions.

- **Export and Integrate**: Once you’re satisfied with the configuration, export the JSON file to use within your own applications or frameworks. This makes it easy to integrate OpenSesame agents into larger systems without reconfiguration.

### Importing JSON (Coming Soon)

In the near future, you’ll also have the option to import your own JSON files, allowing you to bring in pre-configured agents or set up custom tools and workflows seamlessly within OpenSesame.

The Agent JSON feature gives you a powerful way to refine and personalize your AI agents, providing the flexibility needed to build agents that perfectly fit your operational goals.
