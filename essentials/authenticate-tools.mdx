## 4. Authenticate Tools for Your AI Agent

In OpenSesame, you can connect a wide range of tools and integrations to enhance your AI agents. We offer nearly 70 tools to choose from, allowing you to customize your agents based on the unique requirements of your prompts.

### How Tool Authentication Works

When you generate an agent based on your prompt, OpenSesame will automatically suggest relevant tools. For cases where additional customization is needed, you can manually select or configure tools to better fit your agent’s needs. If a tool isn’t supported, OpenSesame can generate a custom tool node to address those requirements.

### Choosing and Customizing Tools

1. **Automatic Tool Selection**: Based on your prompt, OpenSesame suggests the best tools to enhance your agent’s capabilities. These tools are integrated seamlessly, allowing for an efficient setup.
   
2. **Manual Tool Selection**: Use the **compass icon** on the right side of your dashboard to select specific tools. Here, you can custom code these tools to manage data flow, connecting them to particular schemas or nodes as needed.

3. **Custom Nodes**: If a tool doesn’t exist in our library, you can create a custom tool node to meet specific needs. This is especially useful when your agent requires unique functionalities or data processing.

### Data Permissions and Privacy

OpenSesame only requests permissions for data essential to each tool's operation. When you authenticate a tool, we clearly outline what information we’ll have access to, ensuring that your data remains secure and within your control.

This authentication step ensures your agents are equipped with the right tools and safeguards to deliver optimal performance.
