## 4. Hallucination Dashboard

The Hallucination Dashboard is your central hub for analyzing and understanding the hallucination data detected by OpenSesame. This dashboard provides detailed insights into the accuracy of your AI models, allowing you to review paired ground truth values, explore web search results, and export data for further analysis.

### Key Features

- **Detailed References**: Each hallucination detected is paired with ground truth values and supported by a comprehensive web search. This ensures you have all the context needed to evaluate the accuracy of your AI outputs.
  
- **Exportable Data**: Easily export your hallucination data as a CSV file, making it convenient to review, analyze, and provide feedback on the values detected.

- **In-Depth Analysis**: Click on any detected hallucination to expand the response and view the sources of information, along with the reasoning behind each data point.

### Shareable Links (Coming Soon)

Soon, youâ€™ll be able to generate shareable links directly from your Hallucination Dashboard. These links allow you to quickly send your dashboard to end consumers or collaborators, enabling them to leave comments and provide feedback.
