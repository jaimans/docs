## 1. Create a New Project + Connect Vector Database (Optional)

Getting started with OpenSesame involves creating a new project that will allow you to track and analyze AI hallucinations. Follow these steps to set up your project:

### Step 1: Create a New Project

Begin by creating a new project within your OpenSesame dashboard. This will serve as the foundation for collecting and analyzing hallucination data generated by your AI models.

### Step 2: Connect Vector Database (Optional)

Optionally, you can connect to a Vector Database, which enables OpenSesame to automatically pull ground truth information and detect ungrounded data. This connection enhances the accuracy of hallucination detection and streamlines the process.

#### Connecting Your Vector Database:
- **Provider**: Select your Vector DB provider.
- **Vector Store Key**: Enter your secure access key.
- **Index Name**: Specify the index where your vectors are stored.
- **Embedding Model**: Choose the model used to convert text data into vectors.

If you choose not to connect to a Vector DB immediately, don't worryâ€”this step is entirely optional and can be set up at any time.
