## 4. Outputs and Results

The **Outputs and Results** section in OpenSesame lets you view and manage the responses generated by your AI agent. Depending on the actions your agent is set up to perform, the outputs may vary across different formats and applications.

### Key Features

- **Customizable Outputs**: Each AI agent in OpenSesame produces outputs tailored to its function. For instance, a **Twitter agent** would generate tweets, while a **Gmail agent** would produce email drafts. This flexibility allows you to create agents that meet the unique needs of various workflows.

- **Real-Time Updates**: Outputs are generated in real time, allowing you to monitor your agent’s actions as they happen. This immediate feedback helps you verify that the agent is functioning as expected and that it’s producing the desired results.

- **Adjust and Refine**: OpenSesame lets you modify the outputs by adjusting the prompts or the structure of the agent. For example, if a response doesn’t align with your goals, you can tweak the agent’s nodes or tools to adjust its behavior.

### Example Output Types

- **Social Media Responses**: Agents configured for social media can post directly to platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn.
- **Email Drafts**: Agents set up for email interactions will generate responses or drafts in Gmail or other email clients.
- **Document Processing**: Agents tasked with document-related work can produce summaries, classifications, or analysis reports.

### Expandable Output Options

As you continue to build and refine your agent, you can expand its output options by integrating additional tools and functionalities. This allows you to create agents capable of handling multiple output types, making OpenSesame a versatile tool for complex workflows.

By understanding and managing your agent’s outputs, you can ensure that it’s delivering accurate and relevant results across all applications.
